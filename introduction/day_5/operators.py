Python classifies operators into 7 types

    1. Arithmetic Operators
    2. Comparison Operators
    3. Logical Operators
    4. Assignment Operators
    5. Identity Operators
    6. Membership Operators
    7. Bitwise Operators

    #
    # - subtraction

    #
    # / division
    #
    # % modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right
    #

    #
    # ** exponent - left operand raised to the power of right

# Comparison Operators/Relational Operators
    # They are used to carry out comparison between operands.
    # They return either True or False based on the evaluation

    symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value
    of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original
